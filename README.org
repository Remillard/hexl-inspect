* ~hexl-inspect~

This package implements a minor mode named ~hexl-inspect-mode~ to be used in
conjunction with a buffer set to ~hexl-mode~.  When activated, the minor mode will
create a data inspection buffer, window, and display to the side of the
~hexl-mode~ buffer.  As the point moves around in the parent buffer, the contents
will update to reflect the point's position.

The mode depends on the variable state of ~hexl-inspect--big-endian-p~ which
determines how the data under the point is to be interpreted.

The automated update structure and the mode structure was patterned after the
explore mode in ~treesit-explore-mode~ in ~treesit.el~ as that was the closest
analog to what I was attempting to accomplish.

* Setup

This package is not available on any package site as of yet, however may be
cloned and loaded with the following code (and alter the ~load-path~ as needed to
match your local directories.)

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package hexl-inspect
    :load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/hexl-inspect")
#+end_src

* Keybinds

There's currently only one keybind associated with the minor mode.

| Keybind | Function                                       |
| ~C-c h~   | Toggles the endianness of the data inspection. |

It may be useful to add a keybind to ~hexl-mode~ to activate the data inspection.

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'hexl-mode-hook
            (lambda () (define-key hexl-mode-map (kbd "C-c i") 'hexl-inspect-mode)))
#+end_src

* Usage

It should be as easy as activating the mode and moving the point around.  A buffer
will appear alongside the ~hexl-mode~ buffer with the following contents (as a sample).
The endian mode will change when toggled via ~C-c h~.

* To Do List [1/5]

At the moment, this suits my needs fairly well.  I suspect before it's released
for general consumption some additional safety measures may need to be added.
It's also not wildly aesthetically appealing so that might be something to think
about.  I welcome suggestions on how to improve the module.

Current things to address:
- [X] Does not compile cleanly.  Investigate compilation and address warnings/errors
- [ ] Implement more customizable parameters (timer, output products, etc.)
- [ ] Create keybind to bring the buffer back after a user hits ~q~.
- [ ] Possibly create a keybind for dismissing the buffer like ~q~ because the point
  is actually in the parent buffer for operations.
- [ ] Detect when the point was placed on the second nibble of an address and
  account for that when performing the character acquisition (foolproofing)

* Acknowledgements

I deeply appreciate the aid rendered by ~/u/artherno1~ on the Emacs subreddit in
discussing the intricaties of string and buffer manipulation in Elisp.
